<h3>About Cyber Coffee</h3>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my modest corner of the web!</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>When I am not sipping martinis on some tropical beach you can find me pumping iron in the gym. I have a interest in Astronomy and frequently use my Harey Davidson to get to remote locations and observe our universe. You can view my astronomy journal here. I am a motivational speaker at Toastmasters and have travelled to many countries talking about leadership in the workplace </p>
<p>I graduated with a Cyber Security Degree from Coventry University in 2020. </p>
<p>I am facinated with compiler design and kernel architecture. On Sundays I worship at the Church of Emacs.</p>
