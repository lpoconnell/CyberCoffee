<h3>About Cyber Coffee</h3>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my modest corner of the web!</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>When I am not sipping martinis on some tropical beach you can find me pumping iron in the gym.</p>
<p>I graduated with a Cyber Security Degree from Coventry University in 2020.</p>
<p>I am facinated with compiler design and kernel architecture. On Sundays I worship at the Church of Emacs.</p>
